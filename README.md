## Details
#### Overview
Store-API is a web application that provides custom APIs to access and manipulate data related to products. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js on the backend and uses MongoDB as its database. The main functionality of the Store-API is to allow users to retrieve all products and query specific products from the database using various filters and sorting options.

#### NodeJs
One of the main features of the Store-API is its ability to filter and sort products based on user requirements. Custom APIs are created to enable users to filter products by their name, price, category, and other parameters. Additionally, users can sort products based on different attributes, such as price, popularity, and availability.

#### ExpressJs
To enhance the performance and scalability of the application, Express.js is used as middleware. It helps to handle incoming requests, routing, and processing of data. Custom async-wrapper and errors are created and used to manage errors and exceptions that may occur during API calls.

#### MongoDB
The Store-API uses MongoDB as its database, which is a popular NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage. MongoDB is used to store all the product-related information, such as product name, description, price, category, and availability.

In summary, the **Store-API** is a powerful and efficient web application that provides custom APIs to access and manipulate product-related data. Its filtering and sorting functionality, along with the use of Express.js and MongoDB, make it a robust and scalable solution for managing product data.
